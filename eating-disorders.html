                <h3>Key Terms</h3>
                <div class="key-term">
                    <strong>Diabulimia:</strong> A term used to refer to T1DM-specific eating disorder behaviors such as insulin omission or reduction to lose weight.
                </div>
                <div class="key-term">
                    <strong>Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):</strong> A serious medical condition occurring because of hyperglycemia which begins when the body cannot access excess glucose from the bloodstream as an energy source. This can lead to severe health complications including coma and death.
                </div>
                <div class="key-term">
                    <strong>Insulin Therapy:</strong> A form of treatment used to establish glycemic control for individuals who are dependent on insulin injections to manage blood-glucose levels.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Why Are Female T1DMs at Higher Risk?</h2>
            <p>Across the United States, approximately 9% of all women experience an eating disorder. Research has consistently shown that women are at higher risk of developing eating disorders than men, much of which can be attributed to cultural factors, particularly in North America.</p>
            
            <p>Treatment for T1DM requires the use of insulin therapy, which is highly correlated with weight gain. Weight gain due to insulin therapy has been shown to be associated with generally higher BMIs amongst young female T1DMs compared to their non-T1DM peers. The consequences of insulin therapy, such as weight gain and increased BMI, combined with the unique cultural pressures women face, place female T1DMs at greater risk for the development of an eating disorder.</p>

            <h2>What Makes T1DM Management Different?</h2>
            <p>T1DM impacts nearly every aspect of lifestyle because glycemic control is highly influenced by day-to-day activities. Aside from requiring strict adherence to a personalized diet plan, T1DMs are also required to account for every food or drink that enters their body, considering the potential glycemic consequences and attempting to anticipate highs and lows in blood-glucose levels.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important to know:</strong> Attentiveness to diet and the necessity of consumption tracking is vitally important to effectively maintain glycemic control, placing T1DMs at higher risk than their peers for developing eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Contributing Factors</h2>
            
            <h3>Weight Gain from Treatment</h3>
            <p>Many individuals with T1DM experience weight gain due to the unique nature of treatments, including insulin therapy for hyperglycemia and glucose-rich food consumption to treat hypoglycemia. Recent studies found that nearly 50% of those with the disease were currently overweight or obese, much of which could be attributed to insulin therapy and other diabetes-related factors.</p>
            
            <h3>Diet Monitoring Requirements</h3>
            <p>The management of T1DM requires strict diet monitoring, often leading to unhealthy mindsets and behaviors surrounding food. To appropriately manage glycemic health, it is necessary to pay close attention to the intake of carbohydrates, balance fat and protein intake, and consider potential replacements when blood-glucose levels require it. All food intake must be accounted for, making it easy to hyper-fixate on meals and portioning.</p>
            
            <h3>Mental Health Connection</h3>
            <p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and depressive symptoms are another contributing factor that strongly influence both eating disorders and T1DM. Symptoms of depression are high-level predictors of comorbid ED diagnoses in those with pre-existing T1DM, and people with T1DM are two times more at risk of depressive symptoms than those without.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Research finding:</strong> Young women with T1DM "are more likely to exhibit two or more disturbed eating behaviors than their peers without diabetes."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Insulin Omission & Diabulimia</h2>
            <p>One of the major behaviors that lead to eating disorders in T1DMs is the intentional reduction or omission of insulin doses to better control weight. This behavior has proven to be far more common in female T1DMs than males.</p>
            
            <p>Studies have found that 10.3% of adolescent females with T1DM intentionally skipped insulin doses and another 7.4% engaged in dosage reduction. Pre-teen girls engage in insulin omission at rates around 1%, a rate which rises rapidly in the mid-teen years to 11-14%, then peaks in young adulthood at rates between 34-37%.</p>
            
            <h2>Negative Consequences</h2>
            
            <h3>Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)</h3>
            <p>DKA is currently the most common cause of death amongst people with diabetes. It occurs when excessive glucose in the blood cannot be broken down and utilized for energy due to the absence of insulin hormone. Individuals with diabulimia have increased risk for frequent episodes of DKA, which can cause vomiting to the point of dehydration, seizures, shutdown of vital organs, coma, and even mortality.</p>
            
            <h3>Long-Term Complications</h3>
            <p>T1DMs who engage in insulin reduction or omission have increased risk for:</p>
            <p><strong>Neuropathy (nerve damage):</strong> Roughly 50% of diabetics experience neuropathy. Insulin omission increases the odds of damaging nerves throughout the body, including those connected to vital organ functionality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Retinopathy (vision impairment):</strong> T1DMs who practice insulin omission have three times more likelihood of developing retinopathy, which can lead to blindness.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Nephropathy (kidney damage):</strong> Kidney-related damage and/or failure is highly related to insulin omission and can result in long-term health problems.</p>
            
            <h3>Increased Mortality Risk</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Critical finding:</strong> An eleven-year study of women with T1DM found that those who confirmed personal patterns of insulin omission had mortality rates three times higher than those who did not.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Best Practices for Treatment</h2>
            <p>The current standard of care seeks to be holistic in its approach. In addition to early and frequent ED screening of teen girls and young women with T1DM, collaborative care (a multidisciplinary approach) has been suggested as the current standard for diabulimia prevention and treatment.</p>
            
            <h3>Collaborative Care Includes:</h3>
            <p><strong>Psychiatric intervention:</strong> Mental health support tailored to the unique challenges of T1DM and eating disorders.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Nutritional intervention:</strong> Working with dietitians who understand both diabetes management and eating disorder recovery.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Medical intervention:</strong> Coordinated care from endocrinologists and primary care providers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Inpatient treatment:</strong> When appropriate, specialized facilities that can address both T1DM and ED needs.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Resource:</strong> In the United States, there is one non-profit organization called Diabulimia Helpline working to alleviate the burden of diabulimia and connect T1DMs with appropriate resources. The organization helps establish understanding and build connection with physicians, treatment centers, and psychiatric resources proven to be knowledgeable in the areas of diabulimia and T1DM.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>You Are Not Alone</h2>
            <p>While the statistics and medical information can feel overwhelming, it's important to remember that recovery is possible. Understanding these risks is the first step toward getting help, building community, and advocating for yourself in healthcare settings.</p>
            
            <p>If you or someone you know is struggling with diabulimia or disordered eating behaviors related to T1DM, please reach out for help. You deserve support that understands both your diabetes management needs and your mental health.</p>
